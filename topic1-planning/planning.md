### 計畫目標/成果
Start with your research goals)
* start with the outcome, go backwards
* not always at ground level
* realise what NOT to do,
  * not a bit of everything, each commitment is time consuming
    * deviating from your plan - make sure you leave something out
  * new things? limit time devoted
  * planning — do as easily as possible — dedicated planning board (Lego board, whiteboard, etc.)
* Don’t confuse what with how
  * which tasks related to which project goal or research goal
* Specialist consultants
  * identify features that need specialist
  * time constrains on specialist — cost involved
  * allocate time available (don’t work on something else) for the consultants (you work as much as they do)
* 'Don’t be this guy: “In Year 1 we’ll prepare our texts, in Year 2 we’ll process them, in Year 3 we’ll publish our results.” Why not?’
  * select part of the texts to start
  * can do it in a small iterative way — small steps
  * identify the pitfalls, check your ideas about these texts (if what you want to find are ‘in there’ or not?)
  * identify goal, then find tools, not the other way round
  * under time constrain — resources
* Data resources
  * Persistence, interoperability, extensibility
  * goals (for data resources acquisition)
  * persistency (afterlife) of the data after the project time
    * no one will link their data to your material unless they know taht it will be there for a long time (10 years?)
    * huge commitment
    * long lasting
  * future growth?
  * standard format or non-standard format (write down your arguments)
  * document negative decision!
    * why? — can be done later, done by someone else, as student projects
  * document discussions of future possibilities
  * standard form for encyclopaedic information
    * providing information to authorities
* What is a ‘complete’ edition — Small steps and
  * evolving
  * workstation
  * digital edition helps also the understanding of the manuscript
  * define what is complete for your project and convey it to the readers
  * accept and handle feedbacks
  * coding is (is not?) scholarship
